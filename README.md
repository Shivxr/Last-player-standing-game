# Game Explanation: Last Player Standing #
This is a simple Python game where four players (a, b, c, and d) compete in a turn-based elimination challenge. Each player starts with a set of numbers (1 to 5), and the goal is to survive until the end or be the last player remaining when other players lose all their chances.

Game Rules:

Initial Setup:

Each player (a, b, c, d) starts with 5 lives (hm = {'a': 5, 'b': 5, 'c': 5, 'd': 5}) and a set of numbers (l1, l2, l3, l4), all containing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The players are stored in a list pl with their scores initialized to 0.
Turn-Based Gameplay:

The game runs for 20 rounds or until only one player remains.
Each player selects a number from their list. Player a picks a number through user input, while the other players (b, c, and d) pick numbers randomly.
If a player’s list runs out of numbers, it resets to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Scoring and Elimination:

After each player picks a number, the game checks for duplicates among the picked numbers. Players with unique picks are ranked higher.
The player with the lowest ranking loses one life (hm[pl[-1][0]] -= 1).
If a player’s lives reach zero, they are eliminated from the game.
Winning Condition:

The game ends when there is only one player left, declaring them as the winner.
User Interaction:

The player a is controlled by the user who is prompted to pick a number each round.
The remaining players are controlled by the computer, with their moves selected randomly.
